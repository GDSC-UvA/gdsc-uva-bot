# GDSC UvA Bot

A social media bot for the Google Developer Student Club of the University of Amsterdam (GDSC UvA).

## Requirements

We use python version `3.10.11` currently, since some dependencies do not have `wheels` available for versions `>3.10.x`.

## Styling

For styling python, we use [black](https://github.com/psf/black), just run the following command when you have it installed:

```bash
python -m black
```

This will automatically reformat files that are not properly styled.

## Discord

The discord bot is primarly used for many things:

The bot requires `administrator` permissions on server.
